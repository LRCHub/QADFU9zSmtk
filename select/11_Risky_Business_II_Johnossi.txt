there's a knife cutting through my hearing,
no can't take it no more, I fell asleep on the floor
And I'm going through my mother's drawers
finding pills from foreign countries oh,
well I said it before, I fell asleep on the floor
Because it's R-I-S-K-Y business, and we'll be long gone, we'll be long gone
It's R-I-S-K-Y-B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S to dribble
around with your products, your ambition of success,
you've got it wrong, we'll be long gone,
It's R-I-S-K-Y-B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S to dribble
around with your products, your ambition of success,
you've got it wrong, we'll be long gone,
Because it's R-I-S-K-Y business,
and we'll be long gone, we'll be long gone
I said it's R-I-S-K-Y business,
and we'll be long gone, we'll be long gone
