Ah (yeah)
(Risky business)
Girl, you walk into the room like a hurricane
Bad bitch attitude got me blown away
Screamin' no but my body's sayin' maybe
Aah
I could take you home, we could keep it on the low
'Cause a heart won't burn if a heart don't know
Your body is a ride, wanna drive it all night
But when ya touch me then you steer me off the road
You makin' that dress spell trouble for me
Make a good man wanna break the rules
Movin' it just a little too close to your risky business
Danger, drop it for me, watch me, hunt me down
Danger, drop it for me, watch me, hunt me down
You makin' that dress spell trouble for me
Make a good man wanna break the rules
Movin' just a little too close to your risky business
Baby gotta tell the truth, make me wanna lie
'Cause ya lookin' like dessert, got an appetite
Screamin' no but my body's sayin' maybe
Ooh-ooh
I could take you home, we could keep it on the low
'Cause a heart won't burn if a heart don't know
Your body is a ride, wanna drive it all night
But when ya touch me then you steer me off the road
You makin' that dress spell trouble for me
Make a good man wanna break the rules
Movin' it just a little too close to your risky business
Danger, drop it for me, watch me, hunt me down
Danger, drop it for me, watch me, hunt me down
You makin' that dress spell trouble for me
Make a good man wanna break the rules
Movin' just a little too close to your risky business

Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' to ya

You makin' that dress spell trouble for me
