Hide the Key, cause I'm coming over
Settle the score oh whoa
Don't forget how well I know you
Stop Asking
And Keep Dancing
[Verse 1]
You get a chance girl
You fall apart start talking with you hands girl
You'll have to start over over again oh whoa oh
Maybe I'll call up and call you out
Maybe next time you should turn around over over again oh whoa oh
And put, put, put, your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put, your heart where your mouth is, now
Hide the Key, 'Cause I'm coming over
To settle the score oh whoa
Doo oh oh oh Doo oh oh oh
Stop Asking
Keep Dancing
[Verse 2]
Then I am blind girl (Then I'm Blind)
My eyes are always holding in your mind girl (holding in your mind)
You'll have to start over over again oh whoa oh
Maybe I'm the one who plays the game
Maybe I turn and make the same mistake over over again oh whoa oh oh
(And baby you should) and put, put, put, your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put, your heart where your mouth is, now
[Chorus]
Hide the Key, cause I'm coming over
To settle the score oh whoa
Don't forget how well I know you
I'll take take, I'll take take you down
Doo oh oh oh Doo oh oh oh
Stop Asking
And Keep Dancing
Doo oh oh oh Doo oh oh oh
Stop Asking
And Keep Dancing
[Bridge]
I'm talking 'bout change
You really wanna see the way
But if you wanna see
Then you need to settle down
And were talking 'bout change
You really wanna see the way
But if you wanna see
Then you need to settle down down down down
[Chorus]
Doo oh oh oh Doo oh oh oh
Stop asking
And keep dancing
