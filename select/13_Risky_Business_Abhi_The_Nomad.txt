Straight up
yeah yeah (okay)
Year of the Nomad son

New year, New me
I ain't living check to check, I'm Gucci
Tye-dye swagger, back and groovy
I'm neck to foot fresh, I'm Stanley Tucci (clean!)
Y'all can't match the bag, it's too deep
I'm writing movies,
My wifey boobies,
Her thighs in two-piece,
I'm signing no type of fine print my guy,
I'm fine and too free, ah- (honestly)
Cuz I don't really wanna be bothered,
I don't wanna deal with the brand of smoke-screen mirages
I'd rather switch the switch on
And just go sauce on them bitches-
Put them Netflix on
Sip good liquor
Get the Szechuan chicken
With the thick sauce, rip it
All while dick hard kissing my woman
In the rip-off bra,
And then get all in it- (uah!)
You can't see me dance with no lights on,
So I'm sticking with the plan, oh I need a witness
I be putting work in all night long,
Because, I won't take a chance,
No, no, risky business
(Straight up)
Tall dark and handsome I stand
(Straight up)
I got the world in my hands
(Straight up)
She turn around and I get-
(Straight up)
Can't no one fuck with my shit
Tall dark and handsome I stand
(Straight up)
I got the world in my hands
(Straight up)
She turn around and I get-
(Straight up)
Can't no one fuck with my shit

There really ain't much in this world that's better than love,
You should try that shit, I'm leveling up
Like cuphead, nuff said, bitch I am the one
This shits in my blood you can't buy that shit,
Used to pop addy I was high as shit,
Some weed and some Vyvanses (-huh!)
I couldn't read vibes, but I connect the synapses
Sewed the mind maps in came the flows and the finances (money!)
Call me the rythym romancer,
Life's a dream I row the river boat faster,
So fantastic, I am just,
Smooth as cig smoke, pinstripe suits, and Old Fashioned's
So sad that my grammy missed me, but I-
Left this street to snag a grammy,
In turn I make history,
and grind like an idli mixi
Til it's year of the Nomad son!
You can't see me dance with no lights on,
So I'm sticking with the plan, oh I need a witness
I be putting work in all night long,
Because, I won't take a chance,
No, no, risky business
(Straight up)
Tall dark and handsome I stand
(Straight up)
I got the world in my hands
(Straight up)
She turn around and I get-
(Straight up)
Can't no one fuck with my shit
Tall dark and handsome I stand
(Straight up)
I got the world in my hands
(Straight up)

(Straight up)
Can't no one fuck with my shit
